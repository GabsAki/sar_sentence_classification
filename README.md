# SAR Sentence Classification
As a newcomer to Canada and wanting to experience the job market, studying the interviewing process for jobs here was one the first things I did.
A common framework used in interviews here is the SAR (Situation, Action, Result) or STAR (Situation, Task, Action Result).
These frameworks help candidates convey information in a organized and logical manner.
**Could we create a model that helps us evaluate if an interview answer is compliant with this structure?**

# The project
This repository contain a notebook that creates a simple neural network model to classify sentences in one of the SAR categories.
